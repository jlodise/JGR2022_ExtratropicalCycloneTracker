# JGR2022_ExtratropicalCycloneTracker


Main storm tracking code is located in ExtratropCycloneTracker_Lodise.m 

To run the main file you will need to download the files ERA5_masks.mat and lldistkm.m 
from this directory and also a data file containing the ERA5 mslp data from your period of interest from the C3S store. 


The storm tracks contained in monthly files for each basin ( The North Atlantic, The North Pacific, and Southern Oceans) are those identified and used
in the JGR-Oceans publication.
